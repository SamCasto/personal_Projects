This script currently only has functionality with the website myfootballnow.com and at minimum, Java 17 needs to be your Java version. I'm unsure if there will be more functionality or changes added to it. 
The rest of this file will be directly from comments in the source code. For adding the correct file path: create the folder you want the game logs to 
be stored in, then right click the folder and click 'Copy as path' to get the folder's path, then paste what you copied into the strings.txt file. Then 
remove the quotation marks from what you have pasted, if they are there.

 * Author: Samuel Casto
 * Last update: 3/17 - Added comments to the file to improve readability. Have not used the script
 * 				in months. Judging by the folder, last time this program ran there were no issues.
 * 
 * 
 * Description: This code will take input from a file named strings.txt and use the input to 
 * go to myfootballnow league home page/landing page and download game logs and convert them 
 * into uniquely named csv files. The input should be broken into separate lines. 
 * The first line of the input should specify where to download/write the csv files to. The next
 * line(s) will specify which leagues to download game logs from. The program's current 
 * functionality is to only download the most recent games played which are accessed through 
 * the league home page/landing page. It will not download any other previously simulated games.
 * This makes it ideal if you want to consistently add new games as they are simulated. There
 * are no issues downloading game logs depending on game type(preseason/regular/playoffs.)
 * 
 * Intended use: 
 * 			1. Add the correct input to strings.txt where the first line is the intended 
 * 				download destination and each line after it is a unique league home page/landing
 * 				page from the website MyFootballNow.
 * 			2. Run the code or .exe file while your device is connected to the internet and 
 * 				wait until the confirmation message at the end is displayed showing that the 
 * 				program ran with no issues or errors.
 * 			3. Manually confirm that the files downloaded/written were done so successfully and 
 * 				can be opened by your csv processing application.
 * 			4. Do what you want with the downloaded csv files. 
 * 
 * Current ideas for improvement:
 * 	1. Add a way to handle downloading duplicates. As of 3/17 I do not remember the interaction
 * 			as I have not ran the program in some time so this might be a non-issue
 *  2. Add functionality that allows users to enter a box score number to start with and continue
 *  		X amount of times so that users can get previously simulated games/or a specific
 *  		subset of games played
 *  3. Look for runtime improvements particularly in the downloading method and the breakpoint
 *  		method. 
 *  4. Update the name to better reflect what it does.
 *  5. Add error handling in the event strings.txt does not get valid information.
 *  
 *  Requirements: 
 *  	JRE installed.(until exe is made)
 *  	Local file strings.txt with valid, relevant information inside it.
 *  	Leagues exist on MFN.
 *

# personal_Projects
Personal projects that I've made for my own use/public use. In here I plan to post several projects I have been working on that specifically are made to be
used in conjunction with the browser game https://www.myfootballnow.com/. There will be several others once this semester is over(Spring 23) and I have more 
time before I start my summer semester. I plan on also testing/trying out things I find interesting in Java here
